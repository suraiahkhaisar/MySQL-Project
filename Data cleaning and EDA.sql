-- The WITH Clause and CTE
-- WITH duplicate_cte AS (...):
-- This creates a Common Table Expression (CTE) named duplicate_cte. Think of it as a temporary result set you can refer to later in your SQL query.
-- 2. Selecting and Adding a Row Number
-- SELECT *, ...
-- Youâ€™re selecting all columns from the layoffs_staging table.
-- ROW_NUMBER() OVER (...):
-- This function assigns a sequential number (1, 2, 3, ...) to each row within each group specified by the PARTITION BY clause.
-- 3. The PARTITION BY Clause
-- PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, date:
-- This means:Rows are grouped/partitioned based on having the same values for all of these columns:
-- company, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and date.
-- For each group of rows with identical values in these columns, ROW_NUMBER() starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each row.
-- 4. The row_num Column
-- The result is a new column called row_num that indicates the position of each row within its group (partition). 
-- The first matching row has row_num = 1, the second has row_num = 2, etc.
with duplicate_cte as(select * ,row_number() over(partition by company,location,industry,total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`,country,funds_raised_millions) as row_num from layoffs_staging)
